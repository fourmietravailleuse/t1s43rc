Enhances the Media Library; powerful [mla_gallery], taxonomy support, IPTC/EXIF/PDF processing, bulk/quick edit actions and where-used reporting.

== Description ==

The Media Library Assistant provides several enhancements for managing the Media Library, including:

* The **`[mla_gallery]` shortcode**, used in a post, page or custom post type to add a gallery of images and/or other Media Library items (such as PDF documents). MLA Gallery is a superset of the WordPress `[gallery]` shortcode; it is compatible with `[gallery]` and provides many enhancements. These include: 1) full query and display support for WordPress categories, tags, custom taxonomies and custom fields, 2) support for all post_mime_type values, not just images 3) media Library items need not be "attached" to the post, and 4) control over the styles, markup and content of each gallery using Style and Markup Templates. **Twenty-eight hooks** provided for complete gallery customization from your theme or plugin code.

* The **`[mla_tag_cloud]` shortcode**, used in a post, page, custom post type or widget to display the "most used" terms in your Media Library where the size of each term is determined by how many times that particular term has been assigned to Media Library items. **Twenty-five hooks** provided for complete cloud customization from your theme or plugin code.

* Powerful **Content Templates**, which let you compose a value from multiple data sources, mix literal text with data values, test for empty values and choose among two or more alternatives or suppress output entirely.

* **Attachment metadata** such as file size, image dimensions and where-used information can be assigned to WordPress custom fields. You can then use the custom fields in your `[mla_gallery]` display and you can add custom fields as sortable, searchable columns in the Media/Assistant submenu table. You can also **modify the WordPress `_wp_attachment_metadata` contents** to suit your needs.

* **IPTC**, **EXIF (including GPS)** and **PDF** metadata can be assigned to standard WordPress fields, taxonomy terms and custom fields. You can update all existing attachments from the Settings page IPTC/EXIF tab, groups of existing attachments with a Bulk Action or one existing attachment from the Edit Media/Edit Single Item screen. Display **IPTC**, **EXIF** and **PDF** metadata with `[mla_gallery]` custom templates. **Twelve hooks** provided for complete mapping customization from your theme or plugin code.

* Complete control over **Post MIME Types, File Upload extensions/MIME Types and file type icon images**. Fifty four (54) additional upload types, 112 file type icon images and a searchable list of over 1,500 file extension/MIME type associations.

* **Integrates with Photonic Gallery, Jetpack and other plugins**, so you can add slideshows, thumbnail strips and special effects to your `[mla_gallery]` galleries.

* **Enhanced Search Media box**. Search can be extended to the name/slug, ALT text and caption fields. The connector between search terms can be "and" or "or". Search by attachment ID is supported.

* **Where-used reporting** shows which posts use a media item as the "featured image", an inserted image or link, an entry in a `[gallery]` and/or an entry in an `[mla_gallery]`.
* **Complete support for ALL taxonomies**, including the standard Categories and Tags, your custom taxonomies and the Assistant's pre-defined Att. Categories and Att. Tags. You can add taxonomy columns to the Assistant listing, filter on any taxonomy, assign terms and list the attachments for a term.
* An inline **"Bulk Edit"** area; update author, parent and custom fields, add, remove or replace taxonomy terms for several attachments at once
* An inline **"Quick Edit"** action for many common fields and for custom fields
* Displays more attachment information such as parent information, file URL and image metadata. Uses and enhances the new Edit Media screen for WordPress 3.5 and above.
* Allows you to edit the post_parent, the menu_order and to "unattach" items
* Provides additional view filters for MIME types and taxonomies
* Provides many more listing columns (more than 20) to choose from

The Assistant is designed to work like the standard Media Library pages, so the learning curve is short and gentle. Contextual help is provided on every new screen to highlight new features.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I sort the Media/Assistant submenu table on values such as File Size? =

You can add support for many attachment metadata values such as file size by visiting the Custom Fields tab on the Settings page. There you can define a rule that maps the data to a WordPress custom field and check the "MLA Column" box to make that field a sortable column in the Media/Assistant submenu table. You can also use the field in your `[mla_gallery]` shortcodes. For example, this shortcode displays a gallery of the ten largest images in the "general" category, with a custom caption:

`
[mla_gallery category="general" mla_caption="{+caption+}<br>{+custom:File Size+}" meta_key="File Size" orderby="meta_value" order="DESC" numberposts=10]
`

= How can I use Categories, Tags and custom taxonomies to select images for display in my posts and pages? =

The powerful `[mla_gallery]` shortcode supports almost all of the query flexibility provided by the WP_Query class. You can find complete documentation in the Settings/Media Library Assistant Documentation tab. A simple example is in the preceding question. Here's an example that displays PDF documents with Att. Category "fauna" or Att. Tag "animal":

`
[mla_gallery post_mime_type="application/pdf" size=icon mla_caption="{+title+}" tax_query="array(array('taxonomy'=>'attachment_category','field'=>'slug','terms'=>'fauna'),array('taxonomy'=>'attachment_tag','field'=>'slug','terms'=>'animal'),'relation'=>'OR')"]
`

= Can I use `[mla_gallery]` for attachments other than images? =

Yes! The `[mla_gallery]` shortcode supports all MIME types when you add the post_mime_type parameter to your query. You can build a gallery of your PDF documents, plain text files and other attachments. You can mix images and other MIME types in the same gallery, too. Here's an example that displays a gallery of PDF documents, using the Google File Viewer to show the first page of each document as a thumbnail:

`
[mla_gallery post_mime_type=application/pdf post_parent=all link=file mla_viewer=true columns=1 orderby=date order=desc]
`

= Can I attach an image to more than one post or page? =

No; that's a structural limitation of the WordPress database. However, you can use Categories, Tags and custom taxonomies to organize your images and associate them with posts and pages in any way you like. The `[mla_gallery]` shortcode makes it easy. You can also use the `ids=` parameter to compose a gallery from a list of specific images.

= Can the Assistant use the standard WordPress post Categories and Tags? =

Yes! You can activate or deactivate support for Categories and Tags at any time by visiting the Media Library Assistant Settings page.

= Do I have to use the WordPress post Categories and Tags? =

No! The Assistant supplies pre-defined Att. Categories and Att. Tags; these are WordPress custom taxonomies, with all of the API support that implies. You can activate or deactivate the pre-defined taxonomies at any time by visiting the Media Library Assistant Settings page.

= Can I add my own custom taxonomies to the Assistant? =

Yes. Any custom taxonomy you register with the Attachment post type will appear in the Assistant UI. Use the Media Library Assistant Settings page to add support for your taxonomies to the Assistant UI.

= Can I use Jetpack Tiled Gallery or a lightbox plugin to display my gallery? =
You can use other gallery-generating shortcodes to give you the data selection power of [mla_gallery] and the formatting/display power of popular alternatives such as the WordPress.com Jetpack Carousel and Tiled Galleries modules. Any shortcode that accepts "ids=" or a similar parameter listing the attachment ID values for the gallery can be used. Here's an example of a Jetpack Tiled gallery for everything except vegetables:

`
[mla_gallery attachment_category=vegetable tax_operator="NOT IN" mla_alt_shortcode=gallery type="rectangular"]
`

Most lightbox plugins use HTML `class=` and/or `rel=` tags to activate their features. `[mla_gallery]` lets you add this tag information to your gallery output. Here's an example that opens PDF documents in a shadowbox using Easy Fancybox:

`
[mla_gallery post_mime_type=application/pdf post_parent=all link=file size=icon mla_caption='<a class="fancybox-iframe fancybox-pdf" href={+filelink_url+} target=_blank>{+title+}</a>' mla_link_attributes='class="fancybox-pdf fancybox-iframe"']
`

In the example, the `mla_caption=` parameter turns the document title into a link to the shadowbox display so you can click on the thumbnail image or the caption to activate the display.

= Why don't the "Posts" counts in the taxonomy edit screens match the search results when you click on them? =

This is a known WordPress problem with multiple support tickets already in Trac, e.g., 
Ticket #20708(closed defect (bug): duplicate) Wrong posts count in taxonomy table,
Ticket #14084(assigned defect (bug)) Custom taxonomy count includes draft & trashed posts,
and Ticket #14076(closed defect (bug): duplicate) Misleading post count on taxonomy screen.

For example, if you add Tags support to the Assistant and then assign tag values to your attachments, the "Posts" column in the "Tags" edit screen under the Posts admin section includes attachments in the count. If you click on the number in that column, only posts and pages are displayed. There are similar issues with custom post types and taxonomies (whether you use the Assistant or not). The "Attachments" column in the edit screens added by the Assistant shows the correct count because it works in a different way.

= How do I "unattach" an item? =

Hover over the item you want to modify and click the "Edit" or "Quick Edit" action. Set the ID portion of the Parent Info field to zero (0), then click "Update" to record your changes. If you change your mind, click "Cancel" to return to the main page without recording any changes. You can also click the "Select" button to bring up a list of posts//pages and select one to be the new parent for the item. The "Set Parent" link in the Media/Assistant submenu table also supports changing the parent and unattaching an item.

= The Media/Assistant submenu seems sluggish; is there anything I can do to make it faster? =

Some of the MLA features such as where-used reporting and ALT Text sorting/searching require a lot of database processing. If this is an issue for you, go to the Settings page and adjust the "Where-used database access tuning" settings. For any where-used category you can enable or disable processing. For the "Gallery in" and "MLA Gallery in" you can also choose to update the results on every page load or to cache the results for fifteen minutes between updates. The cache is also flushed automatically when posts, pages or attachments are inserted or updated.

= Are other language versions available? =

Not yet, but all of the internationalization work in the plugin source code has been completed and there is a Portable Object Template (.POT) available in the "/languages" directory. I don't have working knowledge of anything but English, but if you'd like to volunteer to produce a translation, I would be delighted to work with you to make it happen. Have a look at the "MLA Internationalization Guide.php" file in the languages directory and get in touch.

= What's in the "phpDocs" directory and do I need it? =

All of the MLA source code has been annotated with "DocBlocks", a special type of comment used by phpDocumentor to generate API documentation. If you'd like a deeper understanding of the code, click on "index.html" in the phpDocs directory and have a look. Note that these pages require JavaScript for much of their functionality.

* New: An option (General tab) is provided to **suppress the MLA-specific metaboxes on the Media/Edit Media screen**. This removes the "Parent Info", "Menu Order", "Attachment Metadata"  and the four "where-used" meta boxes.
* New: Bulk edit area now includes **Title, Caption, Description, ALT Text, Comments and Pings** fields. Text fields may contain a Content Template, allowing conditional replacement of the field value.
* New: **A numeric value in the Media/Assistant search box** will do a text-based search in addition to the post or parent ID search. This eliminates the requirement to add quotes to the value to force a text-based search. You can still add quotes to avoid the parent/post ID part of the search, or avoid the text-based search by unchecking all of the search field boxes.
* New: A new option, **Icon Size**, sets the thumbnail/icon size on the Media/Assistant submenu table. Find it in the Table Defaults section of the Settings/Media Library Assistant General tab.

* New: For `[mla_gallery]`, **mla_paginate_rows** allows you to avoid redundant database queries just to create pagination controls, if you have some other way of knowing how many items a gallery contains.
* New: For `[mla_gallery]`, **WP_Query caching parameters** allow you to avoid additional database queries just to fill the post, metadata and/or term cache if your application does not require them.
* New: For `[mla_tag_cloud]`, **post_mime_type** allows you to filter the tag cloud counts by MIME type so they will match the results delivered by `[mla_gallery]` and other gallery shortcodes.
* New: For `[mla_tag_cloud]`, a new `no_count` parameter enables or disables the computation of term-specific attachment counts.
* New: For `[mla_gallery]`, the **HTML5 figure, div and figcaption** tags are used for themes that register support for HTML5.
* New: For `[mla_gallery]`, a new `mla_style` setting ("theme") lets the theme control use of the MLA style template by hooking the `use_default_gallery_style` filter.
* Fix: The term-specific counts computation in the Attachments column of the taxonomy edit screens is significantly more efficient.
* Fix: Removed an intermittant PHP Warning message for logged-in users without the "upload_files" capability.
* Fix: The `[mla_tag_cloud]` templates are no longer offered in the default `[mla_gallery]` template dropdown list.
* Fix: Default descriptions for `mla_upload_mime` option values are no longer stored in the options table, saving space.
* Fix: **Support for the "Media Categories" plugin (by Eddie Moya) is no longer required and has been removed.**

* Fix: The **"Inserted in" reporting with the "Base" option** setting explicitly tests for all registered intermediate sizes, giving more precise results.
* Fix: Peaceful co-existance with **Relevanssi - A Better Search, v3.2+ by Mikko Saari**, using a filter provided by that plugin to disable interference with the Media/Assistant submenu search box and the `[mla_gallery]` shortcode.
* Fix: Removed support for the ancient, bug-ridden and unused `[mla_attachment_list]` shortcode.

<h4>NEW! Terms Search</h4>
The "Terms Search" features let you filter the Media/Assistant submenu table and the Media Manager Modal Window by matching one or more phrases in the Name field of taxonomy terms. There are two ways to access this feature:

<ol>
<li>Check the "Terms" box under the "Search Media" button on the Media/Assistant submenu table or the Media Manager toolbar. The phrase(s) you enter in the search box will match taxonomy term names as well as any other search fields you have checked.</li>
<li>Click the "Terms Search" button beside the terms filter dropdown. This will bring up the "Search Terms" popup window with several additional controls to refine your search. They are described below.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Entering words and phrases</strong>

You can enter one or more words/phrases in the Search Media or Search Terms text box, separated by spaces. A multi-word phrase is created by surrounding two or more words with double quotes ( " ). For example:

<ul>
<li>' man bites dog ' is three separate one-word phrases</li>
<li>' man "bites dog" ' is a one-word phrase (man) and a two-word phrase (bites dog)</li>
<li>' "man bites dog" ' is one three-word phrase</li>
</ul>

The first example would match each word separately. The second would match "man" and "bites dog" separately, with exactly one space between "bites" and "dog". The search is further defined by the connector used between multiple phrases:

<ul>
<li>'and'/'All phrases' - all of the phrases must appear in the search field/term name.</li>
<li>'or'/'Any phrase' - any one (or more) of the phrases must appear in the search field/term name.</li>
</ul>

For example, if you choose the default 'and'/'All phrases' connector and enter 'man "bites dog"' in the text box:

<ul>
<li>'man that bites dog' will match, but 'man that dog bites' will not match.</li>
<li>'dog bites man' will not match.</li>
<li>'man bites man with dog' will not match.</li>
</ul>

If, however you remove the quotes and enter 'man bites dog' all of the above examples will match, because all three of the phrases appear somewhere in the text. On the other hand 'man bites man' would not match because "dog" does not appear in the text.

If you choose the 'or'/'Any phrase' connector and enter 'man "bites dog"' in the text box:

<ul>
<li>'man that bites dog' will match.</li>
<li>'man that dog bites' will match because "man" is present.</li>
<li>'dog bites man' will match because "man" is present.</li>
<li>'dog bites another dog' will not match.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Entering multiple terms</strong>

The Search Terms popup window has an additional capability and another control to refine it. The additional capability lets you search for multiple terms and the control sets the connector between terms. For example, consider two taxonomies, each with several terms:
 
<ul>
<li>Att. Categories, containing "big animal", "small animal" and "other being"</li>
<li>Att. Tags, containing "male", "female", "cat" and "dog"</li>
</ul>

If you choose 'All phrases' and 'Any term' (the defaults) and enter 'big dog' there are no matches because none of the terms contain both 'big' and 'dog'. If you choose 'Any phrase' and 'Any term' you will get items assigned to the 'big animal' Att. Category or the 'dog' Att. Tag. If you choose 'Any phrase' and 'All terms' you will get only the items assigned to both the 'big animal' Att. Category <strong>and</strong> the 'dog' Att. Tag.

If you enter 'big,dog', separating the two phrases with a comma, the search results will change. Terms will be matched against "big" and "dog" separately. The 'All phrases'/Any phrase' choice will not matter because both of the phrases contain just one word. Choose 'All terms' and you will get any items assigned to 'big animal' <strong>and</strong> to 'dog'. Choose 'Any term' and you will get all of the 'big animal' matches and all of the 'dog' matches; that includes small dogs and big cats.

<strong>Selecting taxonomies</strong>

By default, the Att. Categories and Att. Tags taxonomies are included in the terms search. In the Taxonomy Support section of the Settings/Media Library Assistant General tab you can use the checkboxes in the Terms Search column to add or remove any of the supported taxonomies from the search process.

In the Search Terms popup window you will find a list of all supported taxonomies, with checkboxes reflecting their participation in the search process. You can add or remove taxonomies from the process on a search-by-search basis.

<h4>NEW! Select Parent Popup Window</h4>
The "Select Parent" popup window lets you find the parent post/page/custom post type for one or more attachments. You can access the popup window in four ways:

<ol>
<li>Click the "Set Parent" link in the "Attached to" column of the Media/Assistant submenu table.</li>
<li>Click the "Select" button in the Media/Assistant submenu table Quick Edit area.</li>
<li>Click the "Select" button in the Media/Assistant submenu table Bulk Edit area.</li>
<li>Click the "Select" button in the Media/Edit Media submenu "Parent Info" meta box.</li>
</ol>

In all cases the Select Parent popup window will appear and will be filled with up to 50 parent candidates. If the current parent is in the list its radio button will be selected. You can select a new parent, including "(unattached)", by clicking anywhere in the row of the candidate you want.

If you don't see the candidate you want you have three ways of updating the list:

<ol>
<li>Enter one or more keywords in the text box at the top of the window and click "Search". The word(s) you enter will filter the list by searching the Title and Content fields for matches.</li>
<li>Select a post type from the dropdown list at the top of the window. The list will be filtered to show candidates from the post type you choose.</li>
<li>Click the "next page" (" &raquo; ") button in the Media/Assistant submenu table Bulk Edit area. The list will move to the next page of up to 50 additional candidates. You can click the "previous page" (" &laquo; ") button to move back towards the top of the list.</li>
</ol>

Once you have chosen a new parent, click the "Update" button at the lower right of the window to save your choice. You will be returned to your starting point with the new value filled in. Changes made in the "Attached to" column are immediate; changes to the Quick Edit, Bulk Edit and Parent Info meta box are made later, when you click the "Update" button in those areas to save all your changes.

If you change your mind you can close the window without making a change by clicking the "X" in the upper-right corner of the window or the "Cancel" button in the lower-left corner of the window.
